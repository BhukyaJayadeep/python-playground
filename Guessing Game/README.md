# Guessing Game

## Description
Welcome to the **Guessing Game**! This is a fun Python-based game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. With each guess, the game will give hints whether the guess is getting **Warmer** (closer to the correct number) or **Colder** (farther away from the correct number). The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

### Features:
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Clue system that tells the player if they are getting "Warmer", "COLDER", or "WARM".
- Tracks the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number.

## How to Play
1. The program will think of a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You will need to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program will tell you if you are "WARM", "COLD", "WARMER", or "COLDER" to help you get closer to the number.
4. Once you guess the correct number, the game will congratulate you and tell you how many attempts it took to guess the correct number.
