# Python Guess the 'O' Game

Welcome to the **Python Guess the 'O' Game** repository! This is a simple, interactive game where the user has to guess the position of a randomly shuffled 'O' in a list.

## How It Works

1. **Shuffle the List:** A list containing a space and an 'O' is shuffled randomly.
2. **User Input:** The user is asked to guess the position (0, 1, or 2) where the 'O' is located.
3. **Result:** The game checks if the guess is correct and provides feedback.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with a simple command-line interface
- Shuffling of the list to randomize the game each time
- Input validation for the player's guess
