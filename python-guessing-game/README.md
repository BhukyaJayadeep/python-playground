# Python Shell Game ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to the **Python Shell Game**! This is a simple command-line game where you have to guess the position of 'O' in a shuffled list.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. The program randomly shuffles a list containing a hidden 'O'.
2. You enter a guess (0, 1, or 2) to find where the 'O' is.
3. The program checks your guess and gives instant feedback.

## ðŸ›  Features
