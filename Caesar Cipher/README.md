# **Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption 🔐📝**  

The **Caesar Cipher** is a classic encryption technique where letters in the plaintext are shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This simple yet powerful cipher is one of the earliest known encryption methods.  

## **🎯 How It Works?**  
1. Choose whether you want to **encrypt** or **decrypt** a message.  
2. Enter the **shift value** (number of positions to shift the letters).  
3. The script will **encode** or **decode** the message accordingly.  

## **✨ Features**  
✅ Supports both **encryption and decryption**.  
✅ Allows users to choose a **custom shift value**.  
✅ Works with **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.  
✅ Simple and interactive command-line interface.  

## **🚀 Run the Script**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BhukyaJayadeep/python-playground.git
